## Prompt:

git and Github are tools for helping with versioning of files in collaborative efforts as well as archiving entries for your future self. 
Unfortunately working with git isn't always completely straightforward. 
Jenny Bryan's book "Happy git and github with R" helps with that. The book is available from [http://happygitwithr.com/](http://happygitwithr.com/). Have a look over the index and pick one of the chapters for a more in-depth read.

Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Write a short (100-150 words) summary of the chapter you read in-depth.**
2. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 
3. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.


Chapter 20 of Happy git and github with R goes over repositories, commits, diffs, and tags. These are really the building blocks that operate a github project. While I knew of these terms and what they loosely meant, this chapter really helped clarify their main purposes. Git helps multiple people work on and collaborate over a data analytics project. A repoository is essentially just a collection of various files that build whatever project you and your peers are working on. I think of it as sort of a home base for a specific project. Git uses these repo's to keep a very organizational structure to the project at hand. Within the many files located in your repo, you can make changes that save automatically, this is what Git calls a commit. Commits are nice because they show the history of all changes made to all the files in the repo. All a diff is, is the differences between 2 files after a commit is made. A tag is just a special label for a special commit. I worked on a baseball analytics project in undergrad and we were all working on our own R scripts within our own computers. Then we would meet and go over the code together. I think having a repository which contained all our different files, which showed whenever any changes were made, would have really helped the team stay up to date on what each team meamber was working on. I had never heard of tags until I read this chapter, so that feature will be useful to label any really important versions of my project.
